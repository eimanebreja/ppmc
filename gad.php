                        The Magna Carta of Women (Republic Act No. 9710) defines Gender and Development Program (GAD) as
                        the development perspective and process that is participatory and empowering, equitable,
                        sustainable, free from violence, respectful of human rights, supportive of self-determination
                        and actualization of human potentials. It seeks to achieve gender equality as a fundamental
                        value that should be reflected in development choices and contends that women are active agents
                        of development, not just passive recipients of development.
